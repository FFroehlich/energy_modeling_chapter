    "Aberrant signal transduction leads to complex diseases such as cancer. To rationally design treatment strategies with small molecule inhibitors, computational models have to be employed. Energy Rule-based models allow the construction of mechanistic ordinary differential equation models based on structural insights. The detailed energy-based decription often generates large models, which are difficult to calibrate on experimental data. In this chapter, we provide a detailed, interactive protocol for the programmatic formulation and calibration of such large, energy rule-based models of cellular signal transduction."

    "Cells use signal transduction to respond to extracellular cues, controlling a variety of different cellular processes such as proliferation, development and environmental adaption <cite data-cite=\"2754712/YK9CS8BY\"></cite>. Signal transduction is initiated by the binding of extracellular ligands bind to transmembrane receptors <cite data-cite=\"2754712/QR4JIKLV\"></cite> and then propagated through phosphorylation cascades <cite data-cite=\"2754712/B6ZP8LH6\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/NPR437GQ\"></cite>, ultimately controlling gene expression through modulation of transcription factor activity. Mutations and changes in protein expression levels can dysregulate signal transduction leading to a variety of different diseases such as cancer <cite data-cite=\"2754712/L8NRTXRQ\"></cite>. Small molecule inhibitors can be used to target specific proteins that participate in aberrant signal transduction <cite data-cite=\"2754712/7ZXBI6XG\"></cite>. However, feedback mechanisms and cross-talk between signaling cascades, which are ubiquitous to cellular signal transduction lead to complex, non-linear responses to drug inhibition <cite data-cite=\"2754712/URVR5RD5\"></cite>, making it difficult to anticipate the phenotypic response or resistance to these inhibitors. Accordingly, computational models that describe signal transduction including the effect of drug perturbations are required for the rational selection and dosage of targeted inhibitors <cite data-cite=\"2754712/DUK5BLQ4\"></cite>. Mechanistic computational models of cellular signal transduction translate biological knowledge into executable mathematical formulations <cite data-cite=\"2754712/6JVZVNVK\"></cite>. To this end, ordinary differential equations (ODE) models are attractive model formats as they can describe temporal dynamics and feedback mechanisms <cite data-cite=\"2754712/X784IDZJ\"></cite>. Moreover, state variables and parameters correspond to biophysical entities, facilitating a direct interpretation of model simulations and predictions."

    "Formulation of such models is often a long labour intensive process, especially for large models. Instead of directly writing model equations, which can be tedious and error-prone, it is, thus, advisable to use some kind of abstraction when writing models. For example, the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) <cite data-cite=\"2754712/NF7FZULE\"></cite> encodes models using concepts such as reactions and events, which can then be translated in to differential equation models. Rule based formats such as Kappa <cite data-cite=\"2754712/NAKF6985\"></cite> or BioNetGen <cite data-cite=\"2754712/M82A4YPP\"></cite> employ even higher levels of abstractions through rules, which are generalizations of reactions <cite data-cite=\"2754712/MIF24GAE\"></cite>. While such abstractions limit the space of possible models, they also permit a more compact model description. A recent extension to rule based models are energy rule-based models <cite data-cite=\"2754712/6CAKFQQP\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/QTNJGKHE\"></cite>, which provide an additional layer of abstraction, by specifying reaction rates in terms of energies. Conceptually, energies permit the theoretically sound formulation of reaction rates based on linear transition theory and provides a rigorous way of specifying context dependent reaction rates based on structural insights <cite data-cite=\"2754712/7TJH2IAK\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/DI7IDWLV\"></cite>. Practically, energy based models enforce thermodynamic constraints such as the lewis-wegscheider cycle conditions <cite data-cite=\"2754712/VAJ8A9TA\"></cite>, which ensure the conservation of energy in oligomerization process. This is particularly relevant for the specification of context dependent inhibitor affinities. For example, many RAF inhibitors have different affinities for RAF monomers and dimers, which is responsible for the clinically observed phenomenon of \"paradoxical activation\" <cite data-cite=\"2754712/68C3KR4X\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/GPZDY42G\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/46UNKAAD\"></cite>."

    "Moreover, model calibration can be challenging for large models. During model calibration, parameter values are tuned such that model simulations agree with experimental data, which improves the predictive performance of models. Agreement between model simulations and experimental can be quantified using likelihood-based objective functions, in which case model calibration can be implemted through minimization of the respective objective function. For larger models, gradient-based optimization methods are known to perform well <cite data-cite=\"2754712/INKV577L\"></cite>. However, for non-linear models, analytical solutions to model equations are rarely available, which means that numerical integration is necessary for evaluation of the objective function and its derivatives. Gradient-based methods not only require integration of model equations, but also model sensitivities, which quantify the dependence of simulations on model parameters. For large models, adjoint sensitivity analysis is an effective way of computing these sensitivities, but also comes with it's drawbacks such as not permitting the computation of cheap approximations to the second order derivative which could boost optimizer efficiency <cite data-cite=\"2754712/MKPQ9727\"></cite>."

The symmetry, conveyed by energy conservation of molecular binding reactions, implies that RAF inhibitors, at low to medium concentrations, promote dimerization but incompletely inhibit signaling as they only bind to one of the two protomers in a dimer. As MAPK signaling in NRAS mutant cells is mediated by RAF dimers, respective signaling is amplified, leading to increased growth. In the thermodynamic models, this can be implemented by specifying additional `EnergyPattern`s  that controls the Gibbs free energy of RAF-RAF-RAFi trimers. Note that we do not specify how these trimers are formed, so the change in energy will equally apply to the rates of all reactions that either consume or produce these trimers. In this example, an decrease in energy would equally increase RAF dimerization and inhbitor binding, thus implementing the previously described symmetry."

As the scaling between concentrations and intensity and the amount of background signal is known, we include scaling and offset parameters in the PEtab observable definition `petab.OBSERVABLE_FORMULA`, which specifies the observable function $g_i$ (see $\\eqref{eq:observable}$). To account for noise corruption, we specify a single noise parameter $\\psi_i$ as PEtab noise formula `petab.NOISE_FORMULA`, which corresponds to Gaussian noise (default when no `petab.NOISE_DISTRIBUTION` is specified) distribution, with the respective parameter as standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ (see $\\eqref{eq:noise}$). The prefix `noiseParameter1` indicates that the value of the parameter will be provided in the respective column of the [`measurement table`](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation_data_format.html#measurement-table), which permits the specification of timepoint and condition specific noise levels via $\\Psi_{ijk}$ (see $\\eqref{eq:objective fuction}$).

    "The last table necessary for model training is the [`parameter table`](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation_data_format.html#parameter-table). This table describes all free parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, whether they have to be estimated as well as, parameter scale, nominal values, boundary values $\\mathcal{L}_l$ and $\\mathcal{U}_l$ and information about priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both parameter boundaries and priors can be used to restrict the search space to biologically plausible parameter values, or prevent numerical issues in regions of parameter space where numerical integration of model equations is challenging. Parameter boundaries set hard threshold that cannot be exceeded, while parameter boundaries are soft constraints that also regularize the calibration. While priors are necessary for Bayesian analysis such as parameter sampling, they are not generally required for optimization based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most models, free parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ will primarily occur in the model specification as dynamic parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$. But, all of previously described tables may introduce new free parameters: noise parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ in noise formulas $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ or respective condition specific mappings $\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{ijk}$, observable paramers $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ in observable formulas $\\boldsymbol{g}$ or respective condition specific mappings $\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}_{ijk}$ as well as the condition specific dynamic parameter mappings $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{k}$. Moreover, the respective tables, i.e., the respective mappings $\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{ijk}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}_{ijk}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{k}$ may set numerical values for the noise, observable and dynamic parameters, rendering them non-free. As the parameter table must only describe free parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, some processing is usually necessary to identify free and non-free parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will construct a list of `condition_pars`, which are either mapped to free, condition-specific parameters, such as the generic RAFi energy parameters, or set to non-free parameters with fixed numeric values, such as the `RAFi_0` initial concentration. To construct the list of free parameters, we identify all dynamic parameters in the model that are not contained in these `condition_pars`, and add all newly introduced condition specific parameters in the [`condition table`](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation_data_format.html#condition-table) as well as the four offset and scaling parameters we introduced in the [`observables table`](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation_data_format.html#observables-table)."

    "All of the parameters in the model follow a consistent naming scheme, which makes it easier to programmatically specify parameter boundaries, scales and whether parameters are to be estimated. Multiple studies have demonstrated that parameter estimation is more efficient when estimating parmaters on a logarithmic scale <cite data-cite=\"2754712/INKV577L\"></cite><cite data-cite=\"2754712/FMD3RVCR\"></cite>. The thermodynamic formulation we employed for model construction relies on an exponential dependency between energies and kinetetic rates, which complements these practical insights with a theoretical foundation why model parameters live on a logarithmic scale. However, this also suggests that energetic parameters, in contrast to kinetic rates, should be estimated on a linear scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper and lower boundaries should ideally be set to biologically plausible values. However, most models employ simplified descriptions of the underlying biochemical processes, which means that model parameters may no longer have a one-to-one correspondance to true biochemical constants and plausible parameter ranges may be difficult to derive. Moreover, plausible parameter ranges may not be known for all parameters. Therefore, in many applications parameter boundaries are initially based on educated guesses and then refined based on estimation results such that optima are contained in the specified ranges and integration failures are not too frequent. Therefore, the boundaries presented here are based on the values used in the original publication and where then refined to work with the simplified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to parameter boundaries, nominal values can be difficult to derive. However, the numerical values are only important for model calibration when respective parameters are not estimated. In this example, we do not estimate the initial concentrations and $\\phi$ parameters and only set the nominal parameter values of those parameters to non-trivial values. The initial concentrations are set to approximate molecular counts as measured in the original publication and $\\phi$ parameters are all set to 1, meaning that free energy differences only affect the reverse rate.\n"

    "Simulations in AMICI are highly customizable and while many steps, including everything that was specified in the the petab problem, are automated by pypesto, not all options are set automatically and some user input may be required. For example, the considered example includes preequilibrations which are automatically handled by pyPESTO and AMICI. However, AMICI supports multiple different methods to compute steadystates as well as respective sensitivities. By default, a combination of Newton's method and simulation is employed to approximate the steadystate <cite data-cite=\"2754712/LVNQBT95\"></cite> and sensitivites are computed using the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) <cite data-cite=\"2754712/6AWGLSM9\"></cite>, which is the most efficient option when applicable. Sensitivity computation via the IFT requires that the Jacobian of the model equations is not singular, which is, for example, not the case for models with conservation laws. As we do not account for protein synthesis and degradation, total protein abundances are conserved quantities in the model and the IFT is not applicable. Thus, we here employ a purely simulation based steadystate search by setting the allowed newton steps to 0 and computing the steadystate sensitivities using forward sensitivity analysis by setting the steadystate sensitivity mode accordingly. To apply these options during optimization, we set these options in the AMICI [`Solver`](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/amici.amici.Model.html#amici.amici.Solver) and [`Model`](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/amici.amici.Model.html#amici.amici.Model) instances of the  [`AmiciObjective`](https://pypesto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_objective.html#pypesto.objective.AmiciObjective) that is attached to the pyPESTO [`Problem`](https://pypesto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_problem.html#pypesto.problem.Problem)."

    "AMICI also supports different sensitivity analysis methods for the simulation itself <cite data-cite=\"2754712/MKPQ9727\"></cite>. For models with over 100 parameters, it usually makes sense to use adjoint sensitivity analysis for simulation conditions <cite data-cite=\"2754712/INKV577L\"></cite>. However, for models that also require preequilibration, the computation time of the simulation and gradient evaluation is dominated by the preequilibration part and the choice of sensitivity method for the simulation part will not have a significant impact on computation time. Accordingly, other considerations, such as the availability of approximate second order information should be taken into account when selecting the sensitivity method. In contrast to forward sensitivity analysis, adjoint sensitivity analysis does not provide an approximation to the Hessian of the objective function <cite data-cite=\"2754712/MKPQ9727\"></cite>, rendering some optimizers inapplicable and potentially reducing the convergence rate of those that remain applicable. Therefore, we here chose forward sensitivty analysis for the simulation part."

    "Another set of crucial parameters to tune are integration step limits and tolerances. Lower tolerances generally improve accuracy of the objective function and its derivatives, which influences local convergence rate and success <cite data-cite=\"2754712/RUR9I9SQ\"></cite> <cite data-cite=\"2754712/9T4L23VZ\"></cite>. However, lower tolerances also increases the computation time <cite data-cite=\"2754712/ICNACSXA\"></cite>, so fewer optimization iterations could easily be offsetted by longer compute times per iteration. Moreover, both integration tolerances and step limits influence numerical integrability <cite data-cite=\"2754712/ICNACSXA\"></cite>, which can lead to complications during optimization. For some optimizers, low step limits can prevent optimization from getting stuck in difficult to integrate parameter regions, but if parameters from these regions yield good fits to the data, this can also prevent optimization from reaching good fits. Accordingly, setting adequate values for step limits and tolerances is integral for model calibration. Nevertheless, there are little to no theoretical or practical guidelines on how to choose adequate values. Ranges of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-12}$ are usually adequate <cite data-cite=\"2754712/ICNACSXA\"></cite>, but most of the time values are chosen and updated empirically. Here we chose tolerances of $10^{-12}$ and a step limit of $10^{5}$ integration steps, which is rather conservative, but ensures adequate local convergence."

    "Even with tuned integration tolerances and step limits, integration failures which prevent evaluation of the objective function and it's derivatives is usually inevitable. While some optimizers are able to continue after integration failures by rejecting the respective parameter update, it is impossible to recover from an integration failure during initialization. To still ensure that a sufficient number number of optimization runs is performed, pyPESTO enables resampling of startpoints, which generates new startpoints until the objective function could be successfully evaluated at all starting points. In the following, we activate this behaviour by passing an [`OptimizeOptions`](https://pypesto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_optimize.html#pypesto.optimize.OptimizeOptions) object with the respective setting activated."

    "Selecting an appropriate number of optimization runs can be challenging, but should generally be adapted to the downstream analysis. For example, when model selection or uncertainty analysis using profile likelihoods will be performed, it is crucial to ensure that optimization reaches a local optimum and that the local optimum is, or at least yields a fit equivalent to, the global optimum. This can be achieved by running many optimization runs and allocating large computational budgets for each run. For large models, the total computational budget usually is insufficient to achieve these goals and the number of runs and the computational budget has to be limited, with an unknown tradeoff between the two. To deal with this tradeoff, we will here use a two-staged approach where we first run many starts with a low computational budget of 10 minutes and will then select the most promising runs and continue optimization with a longer computational budget. For this purpose, we use the fides optimizer <cite data-cite=\"2754712/RUR9I9SQ\"></cite>, a high performance trust region optimizer permitting the direct specification of the computational budgets, which can be interfaced in pyPESTO using the [`FidesOptimizer`](https://pypesto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_optimize.html#pypesto.optimize.FidesOptimizer) class."

To generate model simulations, we extract the pre-calibrated parameter values for the best fit of the first calibration round. As optimization results are sorted in increasing order of objective function values, this can be achieved by taking the result at the first index. Simulation results can be extracted using the pypesto objective and the amici function [`amici.petab_objective.rdatas_to_simulation_df`](https://amici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/amici.petab_objective.html#amici.petab_objective.rdatas_to_measurement_df). As the results contains the full parameter vector including parameter values that were not estimated, but the objective only expects estimated parameters, the parameters need to be subsetted according to the free indices.

     "abstract": "Ordinary differential equation models are nowadays widely used for the mechanistic description of biological processes and their temporal evolution. These models typically have many unknown and non-measurable parameters, which have to be determined by fitting the model to experimental data. In order to perform this task, known as parameter estimation or model calibration, the modeller faces challenges such as poor parameter identifiability, lack of sufficiently informative experimental data, and the existence of local minima in the objective function landscape. These issues tend to worsen with larger model sizes, increasing the computational complexity and the number of unknown parameters. An incorrectly calibrated model is problematic because it may result in inaccurate predictions and misleading conclusions. For non-expert users, there are a large number of potential pitfalls. Here, we provide a protocol that guides the user through all the steps involved in the calibration of dynamic models. We illustrate the methodology with two models, and provide all the code required to reproduce the results and perform the same analysis on new models. Our protocol provides practitioners and researchers in biological modelling with a one-stop guide that is at the same time compact and sufficiently comprehensive to cover all aspects of the problem.",

     "abstract": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>We describe a mechanism of tumorigenesis mediated by kinase-dead BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS. We show that drugs that selectively inhibit BRAF drive RAS-dependent BRAF binding to CRAF, CRAF activation, and MEK–ERK signaling. This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice. Our data reveal another paradigm of BRAF-mediated signaling that promotes tumor progression. They highlight the importance of understanding pathway signaling in clinical practice and of genotyping tumors prior to administering BRAF-selective drugs, to identify patients who are likely to respond and also to identify patients who may experience adverse effects.</p><h3>PaperClip</h3>",

     "abstract": "Tumours with mutant BRAF are dependent on the RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway for their growth. We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.",

     "abstract": "Much of the complexity of biochemical networks comes from the information-processing abilities of allosteric proteins, be they receptors, ion-channels, signalling molecules or transcription factors. An allosteric protein can be uniquely regulated by each combination of input molecules that it binds. This “regulatory complexity” causes a combinatorial increase in the number of parameters required to fit experimental data as the number of protein interactions increases. It therefore challenges the creation, updating, and re-use of biochemical models. Here, we propose a rule-based modelling framework that exploits the intrinsic modularity of protein structure to address regulatory complexity. Rather than treating proteins as “black boxes”, we model their hierarchical structure and, as conformational changes, internal dynamics. By modelling the regulation of allosteric proteins through these conformational changes, we often decrease the number of parameters required to fit data, and so reduce over-fitting and improve the predictive power of a model. Our method is thermodynamically grounded, imposes detailed balance, and also includes molecular cross-talk and the background activity of enzymes. We use our Allosteric Network Compiler to examine how allostery can facilitate macromolecular assembly and how competitive ligands can change the observed cooperativity of an allosteric protein. We also develop a parsimonious model of G protein-coupled receptors that explains functional selectivity and can predict the rank order of potency of agonists acting through a receptor. Our methodology should provide a basis for scalable, modular and executable modelling of biochemical networks in systems and synthetic biology.",

     "abstract": "Word models (natural language descriptions of molecular mechanisms) are a common currency in spoken and written communication in biomedicine but are of limited use in predicting the behavior of complex biological networks. We present an approach to building computational models directly from natural language using automated assembly. Molecular mechanisms described in simple English are read by natural language processing algorithms, converted into an intermediate representation, and assembled into executable or network models. We have implemented this approach in the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), which draws on existing natural language processing systems as well as pathway information in Pathway Commons and other online resources. We demonstrate the use of INDRA and natural language to model three biological processes of increasing scope: (i) p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage, (ii) adaptive drug resistance in BRAF‐V600E‐mutant melanomas, and (iii) the RAS signaling pathway. The use of natural language makes the task of developing a model more efficient and it increases model transparency, thereby promoting collaboration with the broader biology community.Mol Syst Biol.

     "abstract": "Mathematical equations are fundamental to modeling biological networks, but as networks get large and revisions frequent, it becomes difficult to manage equations directly or to combine previously developed models. Multiple simultaneous efforts to create graphical standards, rule‐based languages, and integrated software workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs. PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the rule‐based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a high‐level, action‐oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open‐source software community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously published models of apoptosis.\nSynopsis\nPySB is a framework for creating biological models as Python programs using a high‐level, action‐oriented vocabulary that promotes transparency, extensibility and reusability. PySB interoperates with many existing modeling tools and supports distributed model development.\n\n<img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"http://msb.embopress.org/sites/default/files/highwire/msb/9/1/646/embed/graphic-1.gif\"/>\n\n\nPySB models are programs and leverage existing programming tools for documentation, testing, and collaborative development.Reusable functions can encode common low‐level biochemical processes as well as high‐level modules, making models transparent and concise.Modeling workflow is accelerated through close integration with Python numerical tools and interoperability with existing modeling software.We demonstrate the use of PySB to encode 15 alternative hypotheses for the mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis, including a new ‘Embedded Together’ model based on recent biochemical findings.",

     "abstract": "Summary\nTreatment of cancer patients with ATP-competitive inhibitors of BRAF/CRAF kinases surprisingly increases total kinase activity, especially in wild-type BRAF cells, subverting the desired clinical outcome. Similar inhibition resistance is observed for numerous kinases involving homo/heterodimerization in their activation cycles. Here, I demonstrate that drug resistance resulting from kinase dimerization can be explained using thermodynamic principles. I show that allosteric regulation by inhibitors is described by thermodynamic factors that quantify inhibitor-induced changes in kinase dimerization and the difference in the drug affinity for a free monomer versus a dimer harboring one drug molecule. The analysis extends to kinase homo- and heterodimers, allows for their symmetric and asymmetric conformations, and predicts how thermodynamic factors influence dose-response dependencies. I show how two inhibitors, ineffective on their own, when combined can abolish drug resistance at lower doses than either inhibitor applied alone. Thus, the mechanistic models suggest ways to overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are frequently used to mathematically represent the dynamic behavior of cellular components, e.g.\\ for describing biochemical reaction networks. Solutions of these ODE models depend non-linearly on parameters, which can be estimated using experimental data by minimizing the discrepancy between data and the model trajectories. In realistic applications, only relative, sparse and noisy data is available which makes model fitting a challenging optimization problem. In order to take account for the non-convexity of the objective function and to reveal the existence of local optima within the parameter search space, optimization is performed with multiple initial guesses. For statistically valid conclusions it is of general interest, whether distinct optimization outcomes are correctly identified as local optima originating from the non-convexity of the objective function as typically presumed, or if they are only a result of incompletely converged optimization runs and could be merged by a connecting path to a single optimum by e.g.\\ fine-tuning of the numeric algorithms. To clarify this question in application settings, we present an approach for finding optimal paths between parameter estimates in complex objective function landscapes. By analyzing the profiles of these paths, conclusions about non-trivial connections of parameter estimates can be made and by this, it can be reliably determined if two different optimization results belong to the same or to distinct local optima. For optimal path finding, we adapt the nudged elastic band (NEB) method and apply our approach to a benchmark model with a suboptimal optimization result, which yields a preferable grouping of fits afterwards.",

     "abstract": "Dynamical systems describing whole cells are on the verge of becoming a reality. But as models of reality, they are only useful if we have realistic parameters for the molecular reaction rates and cell physiological processes. There is currently no suitable framework to reliably estimate hundreds, let alone thousands, of reaction rate parameters. Here, we map out the relative weaknesses and promises of different approaches aimed at redressing this issue. While suitable procedures for estimation or inference of the whole (vast) set of parameters will, in all likelihood, remain elusive, some hope can be drawn from the fact that much of the cellular behaviour may be explained in terms of smaller sets of parameters. Identifying such parameter sets and assessing their behaviour is now becoming possible even for very large systems of equations, and we expect such methods to become central tools in the development and analysis of whole-cell models.",

     "abstract": "Summary\nClinically used RAF inhibitors are ineffective in RAS mutant tumors because they enhance homo- and heterodimerization of RAF kinases, leading to paradoxical activation of ERK signaling. Overcoming enhanced RAF dimerization and the resulting resistance is a challenge for drug design. Combining multiple inhibitors could be more effective, but it is unclear how the best combinations can be chosen. We built a next-generation mechanistic dynamic model to analyze combinations of structurally different RAF inhibitors, which can efficiently suppress MEK/ERK signaling. This rule-based model of the RAS/ERK pathway integrates thermodynamics and kinetics of drug-protein interactions, structural elements, posttranslational modifications, and cell mutational status as model rules to predict RAF inhibitor combinations for inhibiting ERK activity in oncogenic RAS and/or BRAFV600E backgrounds. Predicted synergistic inhibition of ERK signaling was corroborated by experiments in mutant NRAS, HRAS, and BRAFV600E cells, and inhibition of oncogenic RAS signaling was associated with reduced cell proliferation and colony formation.",

     "abstract": "Combinatorial control of biological processes, in which redundancy and multifunctionality are the norm, fundamentally limits the therapeutic index that can be achieved by even the most potent and highly selective drugs. Thus, it will almost certainly be necessary to use new 'targeted' pharmaceuticals in combinations. Multicomponent drugs are standard in cytotoxic chemotherapy, but their development has required arduous empirical testing. However, experimentally validated numerical models should greatly aid in the formulation of new combination therapies, particularly those tailored to the needs of specific patients. This perspective focuses on opportunities and challenges inherent in the application of mathematical modeling and systems approaches to pharmacology, specifically with respect to the idea of achieving combinatorial selectivity through use of multicomponent drugs.",

     "abstract": "Dynamic models are used in systems biology to study and understand cellular processes like gene regulation or signal transduction. Frequently, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are used to model the time and dose dependency of the abundances of molecular compounds as well as interactions and translocations. A multitude of computational approaches, e.g. for parameter estimation or uncertainty analysis have been developed within recent years. However, many of these approaches lack proper testing in application settings because a comprehensive set of benchmark problems is yet missing.We present a collection of 20 benchmark problems in order to evaluate new and existing methodologies, where an ODE model with corresponding experimental data is referred to as problem. In addition to the equations of the dynamical system, the benchmark collection provides observation functions as well as assumptions about measurement noise distributions and parameters. The presented benchmark models comprise problems of different size, complexity and numerical demands. Important characteristics of the models and methodological requirements are summarized, estimated parameters are provided, and some example studies were performed for illustrating the capabilities of the presented benchmark collection.The models are provided in several standardized formats, including an easy-to-use human readable form and machine-readable SBML files. The data is provided as Excel sheets.

     "abstract": "We discuss issues of structural and practical identifiability of partially observed differential equations, which are often applied in systems biology. The development of mathematical methods to investigate structural nonidentifiability has a long tradition. Computationally efficient methods to detect and cure it have been developed recently. Practical nonidentifiability, on the other hand, has not been investigated at the same conceptually clear level. We argue that practical identifiability is more challenging than structural identifiability when it comes to modeling experimental data. We discuss that the classical approach based on the Fisher information matrix has severe shortcomings. As an alternative, we propose using the profile likelihood, which is a powerful approach to detect and resolve practical nonidentifiability.",

     "abstract": "Targeted inhibition of oncogenic pathways can be highly effective in halting the rapid growth of tumors but often leads to the emergence of slowly dividing persister cells, which constitute a reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant clones. In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "<p>Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are a key tool to understand complex mechanisms in systems biology. These models are studied using various approaches, including stability and bifurcation analysis, but most frequently by numerical simulations. The number of required simulations is often large, e.g., when unknown parameters need to be inferred. This renders efficient and reliable numerical integration methods essential. However, these methods depend on various hyperparameters, which strongly impact the ODE solution. Despite this, and although hundreds of published ODE models are freely available in public databases, a thorough study that quantifies the impact of hyperparameters on the ODE solver in terms of accuracy and computation time is still missing. In this manuscript, we investigate which choices of algorithms and hyperparameters are generally favorable when dealing with ODE models arising from biological processes. To ensure a representative evaluation, we considered 167 published models. Our study provides evidence that most ODEs in computational biology are stiff, and we give guidelines for the choice of algorithms and hyperparameters. We anticipate that our results will help researchers in systems biology to choose appropriate numerical methods when dealing with ODE models.</p>",

     "abstract": "Kinetic models contain unknown parameters that are estimated by optimizing the fit to experimental data. This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is difficult to choose the best one for a given problem a priori. A systematic comparison of parameter estimation methods for problems with tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies provided contradictory findings.We use a collection of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) multi-starts of deterministic local searches and (ii) stochastic global optimization metaheuristics; the latter may be combined with deterministic local searches, leading to hybrid methods. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation and a consideration of multiple performance metrics. We discuss possible evaluation criteria to assess the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer combines a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities. We provide an implementation of this method to render it available to the scientific community.The code to reproduce the results is provided as Supplementary Material and is available at Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1304034.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

     "abstract": "In systems and computational biology, ordinary differential equations are used for the mechanistic modelling of biochemical networks. These models can easily have hundreds of states and parameters. Typically most parameters are unknown and estimated by fitting model output to observation. During parameter estimation the model needs to be solved repeatedly, sometimes millions of times. This can then be a computational bottleneck, and limits the employment of such models. In many situations the experimental data provides information about the steady state of the biochemical reaction network. In such cases one only needs to obtain the equilibrium state for a given set of model parameters. In this paper we exploit this fact and solve the steady state problem directly rather than integrating the ODE forward in time until steady state is reached. We use Newton’s method - like some previous studies - and develop several improvements to achieve robust convergence. To address the reliance of Newtons method on good initial guesses, we propose a continuation method. We show that the method works robustly in this setting and achieves a speed up of up to 100 compared to using ODE solves.",

     "abstract": "Formalized rules for protein-protein interactions have recently been introduced to represent the binding and enzymatic activities of proteins in cellular signaling. Rules encode an understanding of how a system works in terms of the biomolecules in the system and their possible states and interactions. A set of rules can be as easy to read as a diagrammatic interaction map, but unlike most such maps, rules have precise interpretations. Rules can be processed to automatically generate a mathematical or computational model for a system, which enables explanatory and predictive insights into the system’s behavior. Rules are independent units of a model specification that facilitate model revision. Instead of changing a large number of equations or lines of code, as may be required in the case of a conventional mathematical model, a protein interaction can be introduced or modified simply by adding or changing a single rule that represents the interaction of interest. Rules can be defined and visualized by using graphs, so no specialized training in mathematics or computer science is necessary to create models or to take advantage of the representational precision of rules. Rules can be encoded in a machine-readable format to enable electronic storage and exchange of models, as well as basic knowledge about protein-protein interactions. Here, we review the motivation for rule-based modeling; applications of the approach; and issues that arise in model specification, simulation, and testing. We also discuss rule visualization and exchange and the software available for rule-based modeling.\nStrategies to cope with the biochemical complexity of signaling systems without overwhelming the modeler or his computer.\nStrategies to cope with the biochemical complexity of signaling systems without overwhelming the modeler or his computer.",

     "abstract": "Ordinary differential equation models have become a standard tool for the mechanistic description of biochemical processes. If parameters are inferred from experimental data, such mechanistic models can provide accurate predictions about the behavior of latent variables or the process under new experimental conditions. Complementarily, inference of model structure can be used to identify the most plausible model structure from a set of candidates, and, thus, gain novel biological insight. Several toolboxes can infer model parameters and structure for small- to medium-scale mechanistic models out of the box. However, models for highly multiplexed datasets can require hundreds to thousands of state variables and parameters. For the analysis of such large-scale models, most algorithms require intractably high computation times. This chapter provides an overview of the state-of-the-art methods for parameter and model inference, with an emphasis on scalability.",

     "abstract": "Biochemical processes typically operate on molecular sites (domains, motifs, residues). In rule-based modeling languages such as BioNetGen (BNG), reactions driven by the same set of sites with the same rate law can be represented using a single reaction rule. This leads to compact model representations when sites behave independently, but not when a large number of sites interact cooperatively. Additionally, loops of reactions are constrained by detailed balance equations involving their rate constants, but these constraints have to be enforced manually when specifying rate laws for rules. Here, we introduce the energy-based BioNetGen specification (eBNG), in which models always satisfy detailed balance and cooperative interactions are compactly specified as free energy contributions. We demonstrate this approach using well-known models of molecular cooperativity, such as ligand-induced receptor dimerization and allosteric modulation.",

     "abstract": "Motivation Because they effectively represent mass action kinetics, ordinary differential equation models are widely used to describe biochemical processes. Optimization-based calibration of these models on experimental data can be challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. However, reliable model calibration is a prerequisite for many subsequent analysis steps, including uncertainty analysis, model selection and biological interpretation. Although multiple hypothesis have been advanced to explain why optimization based calibration of biochemical models is challenging, there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypothesis and tools for performing such studies are also lacking.\nResults We implemented an established trust-region method as a modular python framework (fides) to enable structured comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving Hessian approximation schemes and trust-region subproblem solvers. We evaluate fides on a set of benchmark problems that include experimental data. We find a high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same algorithm, with fides performing more reliably that other implementations investigated. Our investigation of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identify shortcomings in the widely used Gauss-Newton approximation. We address these shortcomings by proposing a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance.\nAvailability Fides is published under the permissive BSD-3-Clause license with source code publicly available at https://github.com/fides-dev/fides.

     "abstract": "BRAFV600E drives tumors by dysregulating ERK signaling. In these tumors, we show that high levels of ERK-dependent negative feedback potently suppress ligand-dependent mitogenic signaling and Ras function. BRAFV600E activation is Ras-independent and it signals as a RAF-inhibitor sensitive monomer. RAF inhibitors potently inhibit RAF monomers and ERK signaling, causing relief of ERK-dependent feedback, reactivation of ligand-dependent signal transduction, increased Ras-GTP and generation of RAF inhibitor-resistant RAF dimers. This results in a rebound in ERK activity and culminates in a new steady state, wherein ERK signaling is elevated compared to its initial nadir after RAF inhibition. In this state, ERK signaling is RAF inhibitor resistant, and MEK inhibitor sensitive, and combined inhibition results in enhancement of ERK-pathway inhibition and antitumor activity.",

Yet, there has been—so far—no broadly supported format for the specification of parameter estimation problems in systems biology. Here, we introduce PEtab, a format which facilitates the specification of parameter estimation problems using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and a set of tab-separated value files describing the observation model and experimental data as well as parameters to be estimated. We already implemented PEtab support into eight well-established model simulation and parameter estimation toolboxes with hundreds of users in total. We provide a Python library for validation and modification of a PEtab problem and currently 20 example parameter estimation problems based on recent studies.",
